These are the programs performed in practical5. This practical5 folder consists of 2 files:

1. fibonacci.c

2. maclaurin.c 


To run any of the program, we need to first compile the program using: 
gcc -o {executable_filename} {program_name}.c 

We then run the executable file to get an output from the program using: 
./{executable_filename}
