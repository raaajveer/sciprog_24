These are the programs performed in practical8. This practical8 folder consists of 2 files:

iterative.c

recursive.c

To run any of the program, we need to first compile the program using: gcc -o {executable_filename} {program_name}.c

We then run the executable file to get an output from the program using: ./{executable_filename}
