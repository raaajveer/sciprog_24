These are the programs performed in practical1.
This practical1 folder consists of 3 files:
1) helloworld.c
This program prints "Hello World" as an output in the terminal.

2) printing.c
This program prints accountnum, subtotal and total for an imaginary shopping transaction.

3) scanning.c
This program asks for two positive numbers as an input and prints whether the numbers are odd or even.

To run any of the program, we need to first compile the program using:
gcc -o {executable_filename} {program_name}.c
We then run the executable file to get an output from the program using:
./{executable_filename}
