These are the programs performed in practical2. This practical2 folder consists of 2 files:

1. conversion.c : This program prints the number of binary digits in the number "6", along with the number itself,
		  the number in float data type and the number in binary digits.

2. sum.c : This program prints the two sums and the difference between the two sums.

To run any of the program, we need to first compile the program using: gcc -o {executable_filename} {program_name}.c
We then run the executable file to run the program using: ./{executable_filename}
